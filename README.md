# Keychron K2 UK ISO Keyboard Layouts

This repository contains Keyboard Layouts to fix a key mapping issue for the Keychron K2 UK ISO model. On the UK ISO version of this keyboard the mapping of the `§±` and `` `~`` keys is incorrectly swapped.

The issue is described on the [Keychron website](https://www.keychron.com/pages/special-firmware-for-k2) but the firmware fix apparently does not apply to the UK ISO model of the keyboard. Keychron suggested I use [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to resolve the problem but I decided to create a custom Keyboard Layout rather than run the Karabiner application 24/7.

## Repository Contents

### macOS

The `UK Keychron K2.bundle` here may be installed by copying to the Keyboard Layouts folder within /Library or ~/Library on your Mac. Then enable the `UK Keychron K2` layout via the Input Sources tab of the Keyboard pane in System Preferences.

The macOS Keyboard Layout was created using [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/).
